# Code Tyke

Code Tyke is a language learning style app geared to 7-11 year olds who want to
learn about coding and computer science. In our classes we choose 1-2 features
each week and code them independently. In class we discuss any challenges we had
and conduct code reviews.

## This Week's Jira

On mobile, to best utilize space, a question's description is shown in a modal that is triggered by clicking an info icon.

You can see the icon here: https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/HDFTUIH7TVG#/screens/279091047

https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/HDFTUIH7TVG#/screens/279072924

Whenever the modal is open, there should be a light gray overlay. If the user taps somewhere not on the modal, it should close. Scrolling should be locked when the modal is open and enabled when the modal is closed.

Note: you may need to source the icon from somewhere like icomoon. Extra credit if you identify any other elements that should be converted into icons.
