You'll notice that each time you click on the submit button, it takes about 1.5 seconds for the following question to load. User should see a spinning loader icon until the promise sends its response.


## Week 1

## Jira 1:

We need the question area to be mobile friendly. Currently the answers are somewhat responsive however they need to be set for the following screen sizes:

greater than 500px - all images should sit in a single row


less than 500px - images should sit in a 2x2 grid, submit button should be full width (see mockup)

## Jira 2:

Each question is part of a series of questions. The JSON contains a question id (the index of the question its series), as well as a totalQuestions property, which is an integer representing the total number of questions.

Create a progress bar showing the user where they are in the series of questions. Ie if there are 4 questions in a series and the user is on question  2, the progress bar should be 50% covered.

The progress bar should be animated each time the user advances to the next question.
